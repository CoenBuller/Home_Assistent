I now have the code that can extract mfcc's from a sound file and cut it into multiple 
smaller files. This code can also augment to data to 'corrupt' it. This means I have collected
all the needed data and only need to adjust it so that the larger files are seperated into
multiple smaller files. Adjecent to that I also need to label all the sound files. 
To-Do list:
 - Cut larger soundfiles into smaller ones. 
 - Label the data correctly 
 - Learn how to work with the pytorch dataloader
 - Check if for the GRU model if it can continuously evaluate sounddata. If it is given in
    chunks of 1 seconds, can it remember the previouse chuncks when given a new one. 
 - Train and test the wake word detector

I have now cutted the background audio into smaller audio files. I will now work with this but if it doesn't work, check if the GRU will identify correctly if the wake word is seperated over different audio segements.
